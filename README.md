# House Price Prediction Model Using Regression
This repository contains the code and report for the House Price Prediction Model developed as part of a course-level project. The model utilizes various regression techniques to predict house prices based on factors such as size, number of bedrooms, location, and year of construction. The project demonstrates the application of data science and machine learning techniques in the real estate sector.

# Project Overview
Problem Statement:
Inaccurate property price estimations can lead to challenges for buyers, sellers, and investors in the real estate market. This project addresses these challenges by developing a machine learning model that accurately predicts house prices using a regression-based approach.

# Key Features:
Regression Techniques: Implementation of multiple regression models including Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and Random Forest Regression.
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and feature engineering.
Model Evaluation: Performance measured using MAE, RMSE, and RÂ² score.
Web Deployment: Model deployed as an interactive web application using Streamlit.

# Project Structure:
data/: Contains the dataset used for model training.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, and model training.
models/: Serialized machine learning models (pickle files) for deployment.
app/: Streamlit app for web-based interaction with the model.
report/: Project report covering the literature survey, methodology, and results

# Results:
The model was tested on real-world housing data, achieving the following metrics:
